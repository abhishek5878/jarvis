[29/01/2026, 09:16:45] Jane Doe: This is gold! The framework about testing demand before building is exactly what we discussed last week

It completely changed how I approach problem-solving
[29/01/2026, 10:23:45] John Smith: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it" - this quote has been living rent-free in my head for weeks. It's not about predictions, it's about agency.

No fluff, just actionable steps
[29/01/2026, 14:22:10] Mike Johnson: Mental model everyone should know: Second-order thinking. Don't just ask "What happens next?" Ask "And then what?" Keep going 3-4 levels deep. Most people stop at level 1. That's where competitive advantage lives.

"Build something people want" is incomplete. It's "Build something people want + get it in front of them"
[30/01/2026, 09:34:21] Sarah Chen: I've been thinking about the difference between being busy and being productive. Busy is about inputs (hours worked), productive is about outputs (problems solved). Most people optimize for the wrong metric.
